# API v2 - Placeholder

This directory will contain future API v2 endpoints.

## Version Strategy

- **v1**: Current production API
- **v2**: Future breaking changes (when ready)

## Guidelines

- Never break v1 endpoints
- Deploy v2 alongside v1
- Support both versions in parallel
- Migrate clients gradually
- Eventually deprecate old versions
